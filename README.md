  *A rocket takes off for the moon. It flies through space, and lands on the moon. An astronaut descends to the surface of the moon.*

1. **'The Space In Your Ears' by Elisa Caro**

  *I’ve chosen this kind of music, because if I close the eyes and listen to it I dream that I’m in the space. I’ve used “in thread” that makes the music sound together, I’ve also used “play rrand” that makes every beat sound different. If you type “withfx: …” it will sound with any type of effect that you want. Also if you type “sample: …” you can use lots of musical instruments. I‘ve had lots of fun doing it. I will love to do it again.*
