  *A rocket takes off for the moon. It flies through space, and lands on the moon. An astronaut descends to the surface of the moon.*

1. **'The Space In Your Ears' by Elisa Caro**

  *I’ve chosen this kind of music, because if I close the eyes and listen to it I dream that I’m in the space. I’ve used “in thread” that makes the music sound together, I’ve also used “play rrand” that makes every beat sound different. If you type “withfx: …” it will sound with any type of effect that you want. Also if you type “sample: …” you can use lots of musical instruments. I‘ve had lots of fun doing it. I will love to do it again.*

1. **'The Space Symphony' by Chenyang Li**

  *This piece of music describes the universe in a dazzling, array of music. The techniques involved combine classic techniques used in each era of classical music. At first, the bass resembling the Earth is only audible. This resembles the little understanding humans had of the universe at the very, very beginning. When the second melody and third melody come in, the music is less bleak and richer. Humans now have more understanding of the universe but there are still big questions that we have not answered. However, soon, a flurry of discoveries shook the scene. The climax in the music represents this. Dissonances and the interweaving harmonies represent the upheaval of these discoveries. Then the third piece enters and this represents the better understanding we have of the universe. Finally, pieces drop out and bring this symphony to a standstill but the exploration of space continues… forever!*

1. **'Journey to Mars' by Jude Young**

  Clifton College Preparatory School
  
  *This music is about me and my family going to Mars. First we shoot up into the sky, then, suddenly we break through the atmosphere into the dark and lonely space. We keep going up, eventually we see random objects floating by. We now see our target: Mars. We swoosh into landing position and slowly drop down, little retro rockets stabilising us. We hit the hard, rocky and dusty ground. We made it to MARS!!!*
  
1. **'Alien Chase' by Hamish Starling**

  ![](images/alien-chase.png)
  
  Little Green Junior School
  
  *I created the front cover using pixel art by filling squares in a pattern on a spreadsheet. In this music I am imagining an astronaut being chased by an alien. In the fast parts they are running quickly. At the end the astronaut gets shot by the alien’s ray gun. Does the astronaut survive?*
